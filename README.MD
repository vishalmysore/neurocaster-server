# üöÄ **Model Integration Protocol (MIP) with Spring Boot**

This project demonstrates how to **integrate Spring Boot methods into LLMs** using **Model Integration Protocol (MIP)** by exposing them as **JSON-RPC tools**.  
With `@Agent` and `@Action` annotations, any existing Spring Boot service becomes an **AI-triggerable tool**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**
- üî• **Spring Boot + MIP Integration:** Convert existing methods into JSON-RPC tools.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Annotations:**
   - `@Agent`: Declares a service as an AI-invocable agent.
   - `@Action`: Exposes a method as an actionable tool.
   - `@Prompt`: Defines custom prompts, like date formats, for better LLM interpretation.
- ‚ö° **Tools4AI Execution:** LLMs use **Tools4AI** to trigger the exposed services dynamically.

## üî• **Example Services**

### üõ†Ô∏è **Customer Support Service**
```java
@Service
@Agent(groupName = "customer support", groupDescription = "Actions related to customer support")
public class ComplexActionService {

    public static int COUNTER = 0;

    public ComplexActionService() {
        COUNTER++;
    }

    @Action(description = "Customer has a problem, create a ticket for them")
    public String computerRepair(Customer customer) {
        return customer.toString();
    }
}
```

```
{
    "methodName": "computerRepair",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "customer",
            "type": "Customer",
            "fieldValue": {
                "name": "Alice",
                "email": "alice@example.com",
                "issue": "Laptop not booting"
            }
        }
    ],
    "returnType": "String"
}


```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools4AI Integration
To integrate with LLMs using Tools4AI, the services are exposed as JSON-RPC tools.
When the LLM receives a query, it:

Selects the most relevant tool based on the context.

Generates the JSON-RPC request.

Invokes the Spring Boot service dynamically.

Returns the result back to the LLM.

### üî• Customization
You can:

Add more services with @Agent and @Action annotations.

Use @Prompt to specify custom prompts for date formatting or other field interpretation.

Scale by adding additional JSON-RPC tools, making your Spring Boot app LLM-compatible.
